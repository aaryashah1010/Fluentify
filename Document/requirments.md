# **Requirement Elicitation Methodology**

This document offers an overview of the methods used to gather and define the project’s requirements.  
The requirements have been grouped into broader categories to better capture the main functions of the platform.

## **Techniques for Functional Requirements (FRs)**

This section details the approaches used to identify the essential capabilities of the system.

---

### **FR-1: User Onboarding and Profile Management**
- **Technique:** Prototyping  
- **Reason:** We developed a login/signup page and collected direct feedback from users.  
  Working with a prototype involves creating a model and testing it, which was the main way we shaped the process for user registration and profile setup.

---

### **FR-2: Personalized and Adaptive Learning Path**
- **Techniques:** Surveys & Interviews  
- **Reason:** Our survey was the main influence for this requirement.  
  Many participants highlighted the lack of personalized learning as a significant issue, and a personalized learning plan was seen as a highly useful feature. Further details on the AI’s adaptive logic came from interviews with our project mentor.

---

### **FR-3: Core Conversational Practice Engine**
- **Techniques:** Brainstorming & Surveys  
- **Reason:** The concept of conversational AI emerged from our team’s brainstorming sessions.  
  This was confirmed by survey responses where "Conversational practice (chatting with AI)" was the most preferred learning method. Additionally, the survey showed that practical, real-world scenarios like "Travelling around the world" and "Professional" reasons were key motivators for learning.

---

### **FR-4: Learner Engagement and Skill Tracking**
- **Technique:** Surveys  
- **Reason:** Our survey confirmed that features aimed at keeping learners engaged are crucial.  
  Most respondents rated "Progress tracking" as one of the most valuable aspects. "Gamification" was also chosen as a highly useful feature to help with the issue of "Difficulty in staying motivated." Many users also included "Listening and pronunciation exercises" as their preferred learning method.

---

### **FR-5: Platform Administration and Content Management**
- **Technique:** Brainstorming  
- **Reason:** As the project group is both the owner and the developer, we internally defined all administrative requirements.  
  This collaborative approach is a form of internal brainstorming to establish the tools needed for managing and running the platform’s content and users.

---

### **FR-6: Automated User Engagement and Reminders**
- **Techniques:** Analysis of Existing Systems & Surveys  
- **Reason:** We found that many successful applications use automated reminders to boost user retention through an analysis of existing systems.  
  This requirement was also supported by survey responses, where some users selected "Email Reminder" as a valuable feature. This directly tackles the issue of "Difficulty in staying motivated" mentioned by many users and supports suggestions for improving "Motivational and discipline (consistency)."

---

## **Techniques for Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

---

### **NFR-1: System Performance and Scalability**
- **Technique:** Brainstorming  
- **Reason:** Users typically do not specify technical performance targets like speed and scalability.  
  These were set during internal brainstorming sessions as engineering goals to ensure the product is of high quality and can scale in the future. The need for a fast app was confirmed by our survey, where many people noted "Speed" as an important aspect.

---

### **NFR-2: Security and Privacy**
- **Technique:** Analysis of Existing Systems  
- **Reason:** Security needs are based on industry standards.  
  We established the need for encryption by looking at how secure applications are built. This need was also highlighted by some survey respondents.

---

### **NFR-3: Usability and Accessibility**
- **Techniques:** Prototyping & Surveys  
- **Reason:** The importance of a smooth user experience was clearly shown by our survey.  
  Most respondents selected "Ease of use" as the most important aspect of an app, and a large number also rated "Accessibility (works smoothly on mobile, laptops, and tablet)" as important. This data aligns with the direct user feedback we received from prototyping the login page.
