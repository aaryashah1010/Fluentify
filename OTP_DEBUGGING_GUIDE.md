# 🐛 OTP Email Not Coming - Complete Debugging Guide

## 📋 Understanding the Current Flow

### **How OTP System Works:**

```
User Signup (Frontend)
    ↓
POST /api/auth/signup-learner (Backend)
    ↓
Account Created ✅
    ↓
Returns to Frontend with token
    ↓
Frontend sends separate request:
POST /api/email-verification/send-otp
    ↓
Backend generates OTP
    ↓
OTP logged to BACKEND console (not email!)
    ↓
Frontend navigates to /email-verification
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### **Issue #1: OTP is NOT sent to email - it's only logged to console!**

**Location:** `Fluentify-Backend/src/services/otpService.js` (Line 48-98)

**Current Behavior:**
```javascript
export async function sendOTPEmail(email, otp, name = 'User') {
  try {
    // For development: Log OTP to console
    console.log('\n========================================');
    console.log('📧 EMAIL VERIFICATION OTP');
    console.log('========================================');
    console.log(`To: ${email}`);
    console.log(`Name: ${name}`);
    console.log(`OTP Code: ${otp}`);
    console.log(`Valid for: 2 minutes`);
    console.log('========================================\n');
    
    // TODO: In production, replace with actual email service
    // Email sending code is commented out!
    
    return true;
  }
}
```

**Why OTP doesn't come to email:**
- ✅ The function is called correctly
- ✅ OTP is generated correctly
- ✅ OTP is stored in database correctly
- ❌ **BUT: Email is NOT actually sent - only console.log!**

## 🎯 Where to Find Your OTP

### **Step 1: Check Backend Console (Terminal)**

Your OTP is printed in the **BACKEND terminal**, not the frontend!

**Look for this output:**
```
========================================
📧 EMAIL VERIFICATION OTP
========================================
To: yourmail@gmail.com
Name: Your Name
OTP Code: 123456  ← THIS IS YOUR OTP!
Valid for: 2 minutes
========================================
```

**Where to check:**
1. If using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f backend
   ```

2. If running locally:
   - Check the terminal where you ran `npm run dev` in Backend folder
   - NOT the frontend terminal!

---

## 📊 Complete Debugging Checklist

### **Test 1: Verify Backend is Running**

```bash
# Check if backend is accessible
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-21T..."
}
```

✅ If this works → Backend is running  
❌ If this fails → Start backend first

---

### **Test 2: Verify Database Migration**

```bash
# If using Docker:
docker exec -it fluentify-postgres psql -U postgres -d fluentify -c "\dt"

# Should see:
# email_verifications table
```

✅ If table exists → Migration done  
❌ If table missing → Run migration:

```bash
# Option 1: Manual migration
docker exec -i fluentify-postgres psql -U postgres -d fluentify < src/database/02-email-verification.sql

# Option 2: Fresh start
docker-compose down
docker volume rm fluentify-backend_postgres_data
docker-compose up --build
```

---

### **Test 3: Test OTP Endpoint Directly**

```bash
# Test send OTP endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/email-verification/send-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"email\":\"test@gmail.com\",\"name\":\"Test User\"}"

# Expected response:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "OTP sent successfully to your email",
  "data": {
    "email": "test@gmail.com",
    "expiresIn": 120
  }
}
```

**Then check backend console for OTP!**

---

### **Test 4: Complete Signup Flow**

#### **Step-by-Step Testing:**

1. **Open Backend Terminal** (keep it visible!)
   ```bash
   cd Fluentify-Backend
   npm run dev
   # OR
   docker-compose logs -f backend
   ```

2. **Open Frontend** in browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/signup
   ```

3. **Fill Signup Form:**
   - Name: "John Doe" (no numbers!)
   - Email: "john@gmail.com" (valid email)
   - Password: "Test@123" (strong password)
   - Role: Learner

4. **Click "Sign Up"**

5. **Watch Backend Console** - You should see:
   ```
   ========================================
   📧 EMAIL VERIFICATION OTP
   ========================================
   To: john@gmail.com
   Name: John Doe
   OTP Code: 654321  ← COPY THIS!
   Valid for: 2 minutes
   ========================================
   ```

6. **Frontend redirects to** `/email-verification`

7. **Enter the OTP** from backend console

8. **Success!** ✅

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: "Route not found" error**

**Symptoms:**
```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/email-verification/send-otp 404 (Not Found)
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Restart backend
docker-compose restart backend
# OR
# Stop (Ctrl+C) and restart: npm run dev
```

---

### **Issue 2: OTP not showing in console**

**Possible Causes:**

**A. Looking at wrong console**
- ❌ Don't check frontend console (browser)
- ✅ Check backend console (terminal/Docker logs)

**B. Backend crashed**
```bash
# Check backend status
docker-compose ps
# OR check for errors in terminal
```

**C. OTP request failed silently**
- Check browser Network tab
- Look for failed API calls
- Check error in browser console

---

### **Issue 3: "Maximum OTP generation limit reached"**

**Cause:** You've requested 3 OTPs in last 24 hours

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear OTP records from database
docker exec -it fluentify-postgres psql -U postgres -d fluentify

# Run this query:
DELETE FROM email_verifications WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

---

### **Issue 4: "Please wait X seconds before requesting new OTP"**

**Cause:** 30-second cooldown between OTP requests

**Solution:** Wait 30 seconds and try again

---

### **Issue 5: OTP expired**

**Cause:** OTP is valid for only 2 minutes

**Solution:** Request a new OTP (click "Resend OTP" after 30 seconds)

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step: Complete Test Scenario

### **Scenario: Fresh Signup with OTP Verification**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Backend
cd "d:\Btech ICT\SEM - V\IT314 - Software Engineering\Software Project\Fluentify-1\Fluentify-Backend"

## 🎯 Why Email Doesn't Actually Send

### **Current Implementation:**

The system is in **DEVELOPMENT MODE**:
- OTP is generated ✅
- OTP is stored in database ✅
- OTP is logged to console ✅
- **OTP is NOT sent to email** ❌ (by design!)

### **Why?**

**From `otpService.js` line 60:**
```javascript
// TODO: In production, replace with actual email service
/*
Example with Nodemailer:
... email sending code is commented out ...
*/
```

**This is intentional for development!**
- No email service configured
- No SMTP credentials
- No SendGrid/AWS SES setup

### **For Production:**

You would need to:
1. Choose email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, Nodemailer)
2. Get API keys/credentials
3. Uncomment and configure email sending code
4. Add environment variables

**But for testing NOW:**
- ✅ Use OTP from backend console
- ✅ This is the expected behavior
- ✅ System works correctly!

## 📊 Quick Reference

### **Where to Find OTP:**
| Location | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Email inbox | ❌ Not sent (dev mode) |
| Backend console | ✅ Printed here! |
| Frontend console | ❌ Not here |
| Database | ✅ Stored here |

### **OTP Limits:**
| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Validity | 2 minutes |
| Resend cooldown | 30 seconds |
| Max attempts | 3 per OTP |
| Daily limit | 3 OTPs per email |

### **Important Endpoints:**
| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| POST `/api/auth/signup-learner` | Create account |
| POST `/api/email-verification/send-otp` | Send OTP |
| POST `/api/email-verification/verify-otp` | Verify OTP |
| POST `/api/email-verification/resend-otp` | Resend OTP |

---

## ✅ Expected Behavior (Current System)

### **What SHOULD Happen:**

1. ✅ User signs up
2. ✅ Account created in database
3. ✅ Frontend calls `/send-otp`
4. ✅ Backend generates 6-digit OTP
5. ✅ Backend stores OTP in `email_verifications` table
6. ✅ **Backend prints OTP to console** ← THIS IS CORRECT!
7. ✅ Frontend redirects to verification page
8. ✅ User enters OTP from console
9. ✅ Verification succeeds
10. ✅ User redirected to dashboard

### **What SHOULD NOT Happen:**

❌ Email sent to user's inbox (not configured yet)  
❌ OTP visible in frontend console  
❌ OTP sent via SMS  

---

## 🚀 Testing Commands

### **Quick Test Script:**

```bash
# 1. Check backend health
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# 2. Test OTP generation
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/email-verification/send-otp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@gmail.com","name":"Test User"}'

# 3. Check backend logs for OTP
docker-compose logs backend | grep "OTP Code"

# 4. Check database
docker exec -it fluentify-postgres psql -U postgres -d fluentify \
  -c "SELECT email, otp, expires_at FROM email_verifications ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;"
```
