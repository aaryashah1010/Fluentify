        </li>
        <li>Your request conflicts with legal or regulatory obligations</li>
        <li>
          Your request would prevent us from providing a service you have

      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Data Retention</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Fluentify generally retains your personal information for as long as
        your account is active or as needed to provide the Service. We may

        specific Fluentify implementation.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Do Not Track</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Some web browsers offer a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) setting that signals
        your preference regarding online tracking. The Service is not currently
        configured to respond to DNT signals.

        privacy policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any
        third-party sites you visit.
      </p>

        notice on our website for a reasonable period and updating the “Last
        revised” date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Changes will take effect after the notice period, and your continued use
        of the Service after such changes become effective will signify your
        acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">9. Data Transfer</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Fluentify may store or process your personal information in countries
        other than your own. Data protection laws in these countries may differ
        from those in your jurisdiction. Where required by law, we take
        appropriate measures to ensure that international transfers of personal
        information are subject to adequate safeguards and protections.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
        10. Supplemental Terms in Certain Jurisdictions
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-2">
        In some jurisdictions, local laws or regulations may provide additional
        protections or impose additional requirements regarding the processing of
        personal information. To the extent those laws apply to you and conflict
        with this Privacy Policy, the local laws will take precedence.
